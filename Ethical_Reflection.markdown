# *Ethical Reflection on Facial Recognition Project*

In developing a facial recognition system, I acknowledge the ethical challenges posed by its potential to misidentify individuals, particularly across different races, as highlighted in the case study. To ensure my project adheres to ethical AI principles, I will prioritize justice, autonomy, non-maleficence, and transparency.

**Justice**: To address the risk of racial bias, I will ensure the training dataset is diverse and representative, including balanced samples across racial and ethnic groups. I will use fairness metrics, such as equalized odds, to evaluate and mitigate disparities in misidentification rates. Regular audits with tools like AI Fairness 360 will help monitor and correct biases.

**Autonomy**: The system will respect user consent by requiring explicit opt-in for data collection and processing. Users will have control over their data, with clear options to opt-out or delete their information, aligning with GDPR principles.

**Non-maleficence**: To prevent harm, such as wrongful identification, I will implement strict thresholds for confidence scores before any action is taken. The system will be designed to flag uncertain cases for human review rather than automating decisions that could lead to discrimination or privacy violations.

**Transparency**: I will provide clear documentation on how the system works, including its limitations and potential error rates across demographics. This will be communicated to users in plain language to foster trust and accountability.

By embedding these principles, I aim to create a facial recognition system that is fair, respects user rights, and minimizes harm, contributing to responsible AI development.
